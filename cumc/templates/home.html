      <h3>Who are you people?</h3>

      <p>We're students at Cambridge University. We have our own Minecraft
      server which we enjoy playing on. We started an as-yet-unofficial society
      in order to meet other people who'd like to join in.

    </div>
    <div class="col col-right">

      <h3>Can my friend come play too?</h3>
      
      <p>Sure! Once you've joined, send us an email from your @cam email
      address. Tell us their name and email address, and we'll send them an
      invite for you.

      <h3>Do I need anything to play?</h3>

      <p>You need an official Minecraft account.

      <p>If you haven't got one, you can <a
         href="https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft">buy Minecraft from
         Mojang's store</a>. If you haven't played before, be warned: Minecraft
         is very addictive. Expect your grade to drop by a class at least. ;-)

    </div>
    <div class="col col-right">

      <h3>Are you nice?</h3>
      
      <p>Definitely. :-)

      <p>Our server is whitelisted, so only Cambridge students and their
      friends can join. We use real names, so we know who everyone is. And
      we're friendly!

  <p class=cta>We use some mods. (Just a few.)</p>

  <div class="faq row">
    <div class="col col-left">

      <h3>Standard Minecraft is boring!<br>
          Do you use mods?</h3>

      <p>Yup! We play using a custom modpack. It includes science, industry,
      trains, magic, and lots more. Sign up to see the full list!

      <p>We tried to choose mods which would appeal to a wide range of people.
      You'll have fun whether you've never played Minecraft before, or you like
      using as many mods as possible!

    </div>
    <div class="col col-right">

      <h3>I don't like mods!<br>
          Can I play standard Minecraft?</h3>

      <p>If you want! Some of us like the style of playing vanilla Minecraft, so that's
      what we do.

      <p>We tried to choose mods which you can avoid if you don't want to use
      them. But you might still want to try a few of the modsâ€”perhaps the
      aesthetic ones. You never know, you might have fun...

      <h3>My college has their own server!</h3>

      <p>Good for you! We encourage people to play Minecraft and have fun,
      whatever server they choose to play on.

      <p>But feel free to stop by and have a look anyway!

      <h3>But I want to get a degree!</h3>

      <p>Sorry, we can't help you there.
